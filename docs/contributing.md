## Install

Rustup is the Rust installer and version management tool. For Unix systems run

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

This installs `rust`, `rustup` and `cargo`. Cargo is rust's package manager.

## Installing packages

[Crates.io](https://crates.io) is a community registry for rust packages, also known as crates. Crates and cargo work much like npm in the node.js ecosystem.
